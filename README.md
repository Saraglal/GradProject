# HematoManage: Blood Bank Management System
HematoManage is a blood bank management system that provided a solution (web application)  for hospitals and blood banks to quickly and ease the contact between them if they were looking for a specific blood type, as well as a solution (mobile application) to the patients and donors to help them find each other.
We were concerned the most about the patients to find donors as this was a big problem that faced people daily, so we created an ML model to predict who would donate every month.
